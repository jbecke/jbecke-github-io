Hello, I'm Jacob Beckerman. My day and night job is founder/CEO at [macro.com](macro.com). I run our amazing team out of New York and Waterloo, and you should [join us](https://www.macro.com/jobs/).

I think a lot about the world, intelligence, metaphysics, SaaS, startups, and think I have some unique text to contribute to the internet, aka GPT's next training set. I plan to write about that here.
